Project Overview
In this data science project, we analyze historical loan data from Lending Club to identify key factors that influence loan amounts and to build a multivariate regression model capable of predicting loan_amnt.

# Objectives
- Explore and clean the Lending Club dataset.
- Analyze the impact of variables such as loan purpose, interest rate, income, term, credit grade, and home ownership on the loan amount.
- Build a predictive model using regression techniques to estimate loan amounts.
- Present actionable insights for Lending Club management in a concise and clear format.

# Dataset Features
The dataset contains 39,786 entries with the following columns:
- loan_amnt – Loan amount (target variable)
- int_rate – Interest rate
- term – Loan term in months
- grade – Credit grade (A-G)
- home_ownership – Home ownership status (e.g., RENT, MORTGAGE)
- annual_inc – Annual income
- purpose – Purpose of the loan (14 categories, e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement)
